# Airbnb and Zillow Data Challenge

Prathik Ullur

### Challenge 

You are consulting for a real estate company that has a niche in purchasing properties to rent out short-term as part of their business model specifically within New York City.  The real estate company has already concluded that two bedroom properties are the most profitable; however, they do not know which zip codes are the best to invest in.    

The real estate company has engaged your firm to build out a data product and provide your conclusions to help them understand which zip codes would generate the most profit on short term rentals within New York City.
